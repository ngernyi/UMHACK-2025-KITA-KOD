# Structure
1. BackTestingFramework.py - Main controller for the backtesting flow and integration of modules.
2. LoadData.py - Loads and preprocesses multi-source data: on-chain metrics, historical prices, news, forums, and social media.
3. ModelTraining.py - Trains ML models to predict future price movements based on the preprocessed data.
4. Strategy.py - Applies algorithmic and dynamic programming approaches to maximize profit based on model predictions.
5. backtesting.py - Runs the backtest using historical data from the past 3 years to simulate strategy performance.
6. PerformanceAnalysis.py - Calculates performance metrics such as Sharpe Ratio, Total Return, and Max Drawdown
7. ResultVisualization.py - Visualizes strategy results and performance metrics in graph form for easy analysis.
